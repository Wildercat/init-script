# init-script
A script for initializing github repos to be used for Awesome Inc Bootcamp assignments

After user input of a repo name and description:
- Creates a new github repo
- creates a new directory on your local machine
- initializes git in that directory
- adds the new repo as a remote
- enables github pages hosting on master branch
- creates a new branch 'dev' and checks it out

Will require some setup to work with your account, you can check the comments for more details.
